# Langflow Interactive Data Display Component Requirements

# Core dependency - Langflow
langflow>=1.0.0

# Langflow is built on top of these, but listing them explicitly for clarity:
# langchain>=0.1.0  # Usually included with langflow
# pydantic>=2.0.0   # Usually included with langflow

# Note: If you're using this component within an existing Langflow installation,
# you likely already have all required dependencies installed.

# For local testing without Langflow (uncomment if needed):
# pydantic>=2.0.0
# typing-extensions>=4.0.0

# Development dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0              # For running tests
# black>=23.0.0              # For code formatting
# mypy>=1.0.0                # For type checking
# pylint>=2.15.0             # For linting
